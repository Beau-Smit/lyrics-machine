i'm between memories and dreams, between my past and future, i feel like it's time for me to leave the old behindshe's the wing of a bird she's the dark voice of the sea she's a breath on a leaf she's the dawn of a september day  she's the girl with big eyes she's so good, she's so kind she's confused, sometimes sad but she always does her best she's so weak, she's so strong she's been alone for so long she took my hand and saved my soul people change and so did we maybe you're right, let us at least be honest better a clean cut than a festering wound better live all life alone than live this lie one more day  better end this lie right now than live my life just one more day but why do i feel like having lost something precious or haven't i?  when names are thrown to those who know that you're not so tough you've never been that what do i stand here for? what do you expect? you want a master plan? a call to arms? a manifesto?  no, you'll get nothing like this it's just my trying to act my anger  my anger - not the revolution my inner struggle - not yours i've been biting on concrete i had to spit it out i had to bleed i was a veteran dreamin of a war i'd never seen  now i'm sipping on sewage i like to swallow it - i'm in a ditch i was a vagabond just an illusion of your average institution  i had a job and a wife a family car i've never been there so when i see that look in your eyes i'm not a lifeguard, with a towel that dries who fixes a life so when there's nightmares and the stakes have gotten too high, over reactions somebody's gonna know who's paying the price home sweet mastermind how i'm killing time taking all my dreams in a frenzy and they make me feel like i'm dying  static in my brain like a mystic rain takes me over day after day as i slowly slide down in a wave  morning came so soon taking all the moon and i move through the wet morning air to shadow my skin to let me begin to free all my doves  i put out the light i stopped in my fight let them all go all of my love has come my way tonight she pumped it straight into my veins and i could die when words on her tongue were on my mind  i could never let her go never let her sing another lonely song now our love is shining on there's no love here and days are blue and sterile green there's no love here run down the river darkness over your shoulder you need to come down you need to come around  everyone keeps knocking my head everyone keeps saying that i'm no good at it all maybe i'm no good  maybe i'm not worth fighting for figthing for when i said that i wanted to talk to you telepathically  i just wanted to know if you really think we'd make it down  insane plea (?)  got (?) there's a boy with all his eggs in a basket, woven tight. if there's an "us" it's sure to end tonight. it's just the way you say such words with conviction, yet escape my animosity or focused hate. i guess that's my demise. abandon opening letters forget to mention your name neither ever carries anything you can afford peel the sticker off the place where you stay death to stories death to songs death to stories death to songs make plans to sleep in shirtless after seven days write your way right through your writs i couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs i shouldn't let you kick me when i'm down my baby  i find out everybody knows that you've been using me i'm surprised you let me stay around you  one day i'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart we gotta level before we go and tear this love apart  there's no fight you can't fight this battle of love with me you win again, so little time, we do nothing but compete there's no life on earth, no other could see me through you win again, some never try but if anybody can, we can mean what you say what you say will be heard in between of strangers lines you will need sugar to work before you get the salt in the mines is it really a contradiction or just a place vis-à-vis every raindrop is just as important as the sun for me  some say that the flowers bloom i'd say they're alive some would call it colourless i'd just say it's white don't wanna dream sometimes i sleep all day, god bless all of you now but i've been that way on the road, i try to give a sense to what i made i don't know how to fly my eyes just opened as i wake up her voice surrounds my head she's calling when i see you i fall in love so hold your body to my skin so i can feel the blood boil and let it go on until it fills my heart and now her voice, surrounds my head her smell confuses my feelings i can't go on it's over she's a nightmare the only need to survive my lover in the dark days yeah, this is real!
